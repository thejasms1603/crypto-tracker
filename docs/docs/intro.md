  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Mobile App Setup (Optional)
